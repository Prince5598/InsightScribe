This research introduces a groundbreaking AI-driven framework for optimizing link selection in LTE-based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, a critical component of intelligent transportation systems.  The primary objective is to minimize latency and enhance the reliability of data transmission in the inherently dynamic environment of vehicular networks.  Leveraging the extensive Berlin dataset, a rich source of real-world data encompassing Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom base stations under diverse driving scenarios, the study trains and evaluates three sophisticated machine learning models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Elastic Net regression.  Rigorous data preprocessing is crucial, involving meticulous handling of missing values through a stratified mean imputation technique based on latency percentiles, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.  Furthermore, Principal Component Analysis is strategically employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, improving model efficiency and reducing computational complexity without sacrificing predictive power.  The performance of each model is meticulously assessed using standard evaluation metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared, with k-fold cross-validation employed to guarantee the robustness and generalizability of the results.  The findings consistently demonstrate the superior performance of XGBoost, achieving an exceptionally high R-squared value of approximately 0.93 and a remarkably low RMSE, signifying exceptional predictive accuracy in estimating data transmission latency.  This superior performance is attributed to XGBoost's ability to handle complex relationships within the data and its inherent robustness to noise.  Beyond the predictive modeling, the framework integrates a sophisticated communication management layer responsible for securing and optimizing data transmission.  This layer leverages the real-time latency predictions to dynamically select optimal communication paths, ensuring efficient and reliable data flow.  The proposed AI-enabled framework offers a significant advancement over traditional link selection methods, addressing their inherent limitations in handling the dynamic nature of V2X communication. This research contributes significantly to the field by showcasing the immense potential of machine learning in enhancing the safety and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems.  Future research directions include expanding the framework's adaptability to diverse geographical regions, accommodating a broader spectrum of traffic conditions, and integrating it with other communication technologies to create a truly comprehensive and robust V2X communication system. The successful application of XGBoost underscores the viability of advanced machine learning techniques for solving complex real-world problems in the rapidly evolving field of intelligent transportation.  The accuracy and efficiency demonstrated by this research pave the way for safer, more reliable, and efficient vehicular communication, ultimately contributing to the development of smarter and more responsive cities.  The study's comprehensive methodology and rigorous evaluation make it a significant contribution to the literature, providing a valuable blueprint for future research in this critical area. The integration of AI into V2X communication, as demonstrated here, represents a paradigm shift, leading to more efficient resource utilization and enhanced safety for all road users.  The observed superior performance of XGBoost underscores the potential for leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to improve various aspects of intelligent transportation systems.
