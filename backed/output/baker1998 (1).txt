## An Unexpected Product From Polymerase Chain Reaction-Mediated Site-Directed Mutagenesis Due to
 Misalignment of the Mismatched Primer

DARREN W. BAKER, PAUL G. ROTHBERG

_Kansas City, Missouri_

**Background:** The I1307K (T3920~A) variant of the _APC_ gene has been identi-
fied as a potential risk factor for colorectal cancer and is present in 6% of Ash-
kenazi Jews. Screening for this mutation may allow identification of people at
elevated risk who would benefit from increased surveillance.
**Methods and Results:** We designed an assay to detect the T3920~A allele using a
primer mismatched at the 3' terminal nucleotide in the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) to generate a recognition site for the restriction enzyme _Mse_ I. After opti-
mization of the PCR for magnesium ion concentration and annealing tempera-
ture, the amplicon did not cut completely with the restriction enzyme in each of
four tested DNAs. Sequence analysis of the PCR product that was resistant to
digestion revealed that the T3920 ~A variant was not present. The artifact was
caused by a single nuclcotide loop-out in the genomic DNA template under the 3'
region of the primer, which allowed the 3' terminal base of the primer to hybridize
properly. As a result, the mismatched primer created a modified product different
from that originally planned. At a magnesium ion concentration below the opti-
mum for product yield, most of the product was digested by Mse I. Scquence anal-
ysis showed that, under these conditions, the intended product was produced.
**Conclusions:** Mismatched primers can produce unintended products in a PCR
due to looping out of a nuclcotide in the template or the primer. The magnesium
ion concentration can inlluence the sequence and amount of the product.
