This research delves into the critical need for enhanced privacy and security within Sensor-Cloud Infrastructures (S-CI) in healthcare, addressing the limitations of traditional Trusted Authority (TA) models.  Recognizing the vulnerabilities of centralized systems, the study proposes a novel Blockchain-Based Access Control Model (BBACM) to safeguard sensitive patient data, including physiological parameters (PPPs) and Personal Health Information (PHI).  By leveraging the decentralized and tamper-proof nature of blockchain technology, the BBACM eliminates the single point of failure inherent in TA-based architectures, bolstering the overall security and resilience of the system.  The study meticulously examines the challenges posed by conventional S-CI models and articulates how the proposed blockchain-based system and BBACM offer significant improvements.  A practical use case scenario involving a paralysis patient requiring access from multiple medical entities underscores the real-world applicability and effectiveness of the model.  The implementation, built upon Hyperledger Fabric and Composer, underwent rigorous performance and security analyses, encompassing estimations of mining difficulty and scalability, thus demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of the approach.  Furthermore, the study explored the complexities of access control, meticulously examining how the BBACM manages authorization rights effectively and securely.  This detailed analysis reinforces the contribution of BBACM to a more robust and reliable healthcare data management framework.  Experimental results showcased notable advancements in fine-grained access control, security, privacy, scalability, and the availability of PHI, solidifying the advantages of the proposed model.  The research also contextualizes its findings within the broader landscape of existing studies focusing on enhancing security and privacy in cloud-based e-healthcare systems.  These studies explore various approaches, including attribute-based encryption, secure key management schemes, and blockchain-based access control mechanisms, particularly in the context of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) and cloud environments.  Existing literature also highlights architectures and frameworks for secure data management and access, such as MedRec for permission management, and diverse blockchain-based solutions for auditable storage and sharing of IoT data.  These approaches often incorporate smart contracts, decentralized capability-based access control, and dynamic policies, sometimes enhanced by machine learning algorithms.  The research landscape also encompasses studies investigating consensus protocols for scalability, GDPR compliance in data processing, and anonymization techniques to further protect patient privacy.  Furthermore, the integration of cloud computing with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for fine-grained data access control is an active area of research, alongside scalable and redactable blockchain implementations.  The current study contributes to this evolving field by demonstrating the practical application of blockchain in addressing the pressing needs for secure and privacy-preserving solutions in e-healthcare.  Finally, the study concludes by highlighting the promising potential of BBACM for future applications in emergency management and complex healthcare scenarios, emphasizing its contribution to secure and efficient patient data management and positioning it as a valuable advancement in the pursuit of robust and reliable healthcare data management.
