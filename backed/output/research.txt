I. INTRODUCTION
Link selection in V2X refers to selecting an appropriate
channel to transmit data between two inter-connected nodes.
The main objective of link selection is to provide reliable
data communication by considering factors such as latency,
data rate, throughput, bandwidth, and other environmental
factors. This study aims to choose the most reliable link
for communication between multiple base stations based on
their reach and efficiency in data transmission. According
to [1], around 1.19 million people lead to death from road
accidents globally. V2X communication can help to reduce
road accidents by giving expeditious feedback on the changing
road conditions. It also facilitates traffic management by
providing real-time traffic updates which helps vehicles select
less congested routes.
The traditional solutions, such as improvements in the
infrastructure, enforcement of laws, and safety regulations
in vehicles taken to solve this problem, are reactive rather
than proactive. These solutions do not address the problem
as they do not leverage real-time data transfer of changing
road conditions and driving behaviors. They are also timeconsuming and costly. In [2], the Marouan et al., relied on
beam selection, which encompasses the most optimal and
efficient beamforming direction for data transmission between
communication entities. Q-REDD’s method of stable matchingbased routing, D2D communication, and emergency message
dissemination techniques offers scalability and adaptability in


dynamic V2X environments Saleh et al. [3]. Using a multiagent actor-critic approach, it can adapt to changing V2X data
traffic patterns and adjust resource allocation parameters based
on real-time conditions, according to Anupama et al. [4].
The paper [5] by Bharatwaja et al. included a broader
spectrum of AI technologies and communication standards in
autonomous driving. The optimization scheme and resource
management principles given in Ref. [6] for 5G networks
support V2X communication indirectly and express link
selection for V2X communication by reducing noise, enhancing
network performance, and minimizing resource utilization.
The overall performance can be enhanced by minimizing
the number of active RRHs based on traffic demand and
uplink bandwidth constraints, leading to more effective link
selection. In their paper, Sohan et al. [7] addressed the
problems of LTE-based vehicle-to-everything communication.
It mainly talked about resource allocation, which is important
for selecting links for users, security, and the need for a
physical layer structure for LTE V2X communication by
supporting link selection. The 5G for V2X communication Ref.

[8] highlighted key enabling technologies for next-gen V2X
communication. It focused on the need for an extraordinary
V2X communication network with the capacity to facilitate
hyperfast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency information exchange.
The real-time data exchange between the vehicles through
wireless networks with speed, direction, and position connects
to link selection for V2X communication by Mohammed et
_al. [9]. Their study provides insights into 5G communication_
technologies and the technological aspects of dedicated
short-range communications (DSRC) and cellular vehicle-toeverything (C-V2X) communication.
In this study, it has incorporated dimensionality reduction
technique, and principal component analysis, which reduces the
dataset’s dimensions, providing valuable insights and enhanced
visualization. It helps in the dimensional reduction of the
features by grouping features with similarities in one principal
component. Many papers lack this technique, but this research
helped in feature extraction and noise reduction, which led
to a focus on the significant features. Further, the missing
values of the independent features of the data set [10] were
handled concerning the target variable latency. The latency
range was found, and then equal groups were made based on
their percentile distribution. Considering one group of latency,


-----

data on all the independent features lying in that range was
taken, and then mean imputation was performed on it. The
missing values in that stratum were replaced by the mean. This
strategy upholds context-relevant services and safeguards the
dataset’s integrity. Regularization of data is also done to prevent
the model from overfitting. If the model overfits, it only learns
the data fluctuations from the dataset used for training and
does not provide an efficient result on unseen data. Performing
this technique makes the research more generalized and also
enhances its reliability.

_A. Research Contributions_

The research contributions are as follows:

_• Extensive_ data processing has been performed on
data from diverse driving environments with multiple
operators, including handling missing values and outliers,
principal component analysis for feature reduction, and
normalization.

_• We propose a framework for efficient communication_
channel selection (link selection) using ML to perform
low-latency data transmission. It requires training multiple
ML models, such as random forest, XGBoost, and linear
regression, along with elastic-net regularization, to predict
and compare data transmission latency in the different
network operators.

_• The model’s robustness is ensured using kfold cross_
validation and its performance is assessed using evaluation
metrics including rmse and r-square values.

_B. Organization of the Paper_

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section
II discusses the system model and problem formulation,
and Section III presents a detailed description of the
proposed system approach. Subsequently, Section IV offers an
assessment of the proposed approach’s performance. Finally,
section V shows the research conclusion and prospects.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

The proposed system focuses on link selection, a crucial
aspect of V2X communication. For this purpose, the data is
collected by a vehicle movement measurement campaign in
Berlin by framing a route that includes urban areas, parks,
tunnels, and highways. This campaign was carried out with two
driving modes: platoon and 2x2. Measurement tools are placed
in each vehicle, which helps test, analyze, and measure the
data related to the cellular network. A wireless communication
technology is transmitted to the servers following the datagathering process. The TCP/IP protocol is used at the transport
layer to transmit information to the server. The data is
pre-processed at the server, where the missing values are
handled, and normalization is done if needed. After preprocessing comes data processing, where the patterns in the
data are analyzed, and the ML algorithms are involved. The
pre-processed and processed data are stored in the server’s
database. The server sends Data to base stations when the base
station requests it. The problem that arises in the transfer is data


security. To solve this, the data is encrypted, and to optimize the
transfer process, It is compressed before transmitting. Special
protocols are being used to transmit the data from the server
to the base station for reliable and efficient data transfer. In the
current generation, 5G, the latest technology in the industry, is
employed to transmit data at increased data rates and reduced
latency. The data received at the base station is decoded and
processed, then transferred to the connected vehicle in the
coverage range of the base station.
During the measurement, the vehicles will be continuously
moving, so collecting data at every moment is difficult. The
solution is sampling, which means collecting data at a specific
interval. The sampling interval helps collect the data efficiently
and also helps maintain the uniformity of the data. The given
formula determines the sampling interval and is denoted by α
in Eq. 1.

_α =_ [D] (1)

M

where,
(D) denotes the total measurement duration and (M) is the total
number of measurements.
The distance traveled by vehicles during the campaign is
symbolized as β in Eq. 2.

_β = N × RL_ (2)

where,
(N) denotes the total number of rounds taken. (RL) is the route
per round length.
For identifying the quality of a link, it is important to
calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A higher SNR value
indicates less noise interference and an enhanced quality link.
For inspecting the received signal strength aligned with noise,
SNR is calculated as Eq.3.

SNR = [Signal power] (3)

Noise power

This research is for the application in real-time; for this
objective, it is significant to calculate the data rate value. It
helps determine how rapidly the data can be transmitted. For
this approach, it is denoted by θ in Eq. 4.

_θ =_ [S] (4)

T


where,
(S) denotes the data received. (T) denotes duration for data
transmission.
The packet error ratio (PER) is evaluated to find the error
rate. Lower values of PER mean fewer packets with errors, and
the link has a high data throughput. It is denoted by λ in Eq.
5.

_λ =_ [Number of Corrupted Packets] (5)

strength and quality over a limited range. γ symbolizes the
link range and is calculated as Eq. 6

_γ = F(β, SNR, λ)_ (6)

where (F) represents the function that calculates the link range
based on the three parameters. β is the distance calculated in
Eq. 2, SNR ratio calculated in Eq. 3, In Eq. 5, λ represents the
packet error ratio.
By training the machine learning (ML) algorithms on the
traits of the network layer, the latency can be predicted. It is
denoted by δ in Eq. 7.

_δ = MNLC_ (7)

where (M) is the ML algorithm trained on network
layer characteristics (NLC), such as IP addressing, error
identification and resolution, network congestion, routing
protocols, and more. To determine the data transmission rate
from the source to the destination, Throughput needs to be
assessed. It helps to inspect and analyze the performance of
the network. It is denoted by η in Eq. 8.

_η = TALC_ (8)

where (T) is the ML algorithm trained. ALC represents the
application layer characteristics such as data authentication
and authorization, data compression, resource sharing, and
application protocols such as HTTP and FTP.

III. PROPOSED APPROACH

This section presents the layer framework for AI-based link
selection for V2X communication. It has four layers: data
acquirement, data pre-processing, training, and communication
marginal. The following subsections describe each layer.

_A. Data Acquirement Layer_

The Berlin dataset has been collected from drive tests around
West Berlin, along with some routes. The route included
highways, parks, residential areas, and tunnels. The route
length is 17.2 km, and in one run, it takes 45 minutes for
a round on a weekday morning. In 3 days, the Berlin dataset
developers have driven 17 clockwise rounds along with the
measurements of the route, with 4 cars operating on two of
these driving modes. One is Platoon, and the other is 2x2.
Each car is given a unique UL/DL profile for each round used
for data transmission. Also, unique port numbers are assigned
to each car, which helps in data pre-processing. Sensors like
an accelerometer are installed to check the car’s acceleration,
a gyroscope is employed for assistance in navigation and
orientation, and GPS is installed for location. Data is exchanged
between the car and the server using LTE by employing the
corresponding measurement equipment in each car. Among the
four cars, two are connected to Vodafone, and the other two
are connected to Deutsche Telekom. In the rest of the paper, it
will be denoted as Operator 1 and Operator 2, respectively.
With the DME installed in each car, there is an antenna,
modem, and GPS receiver, which help in communication
with the cellular network. It also uses applications such as


MobileInsight, which helps with cellular network performance;
TCPdump, which is used to get network traffic data; and
Iperf, which is used for maximum bandwidth performance.
Firstly, DME transfers the data collected by the sensors to the
base stations in the coverage area over LTE. Once the data
is received at the base station, it is further transferred to the
destination server through the core network for further data
processing.

_B. Data pre-processing layer_

The Berlin dataset [10] contains many missing values that
must be handled before making any prediction. Firstly, five
features with the most missing values were taken and handled.
Take 5 ranges of the target variable (latency), separate the rows
for each range, take a mean of those rows of that particular
feature, and replace them with the missing values present
for the same latency range. The same methodology will be
applied to both datasets. Principle component analysis (PCA)
applied to the dataset was found to be important and affected
features for link selection. It helps in reducing features for a
better prediction process. For the rest of the column’s missing
values, handling typically takes a mean of all the present values
and replaces the missing ones with the mean. The dataset
is normalized because it has to be scaled down between a
common range to ensure that all the features present in each
dataset contribute equally to the predictions. After the preprocessing, the data is further analyzed using ML algorithms.

where,
n is the number of observations.
_xi and yi are individual observations of variables X and Y._
_x¯ and ¯y are the sample means of variables X and Y,_
respectively.
The covariance matrix is used in PCA because it gives data
about the variance and relationship between the features in the
dataset.

� _v = λv_ (10)

where,
v is an eigenvector.
_λ is an eigenvalue._
Eigenvalues show the quantity of variance explained by
each PCA. To prevent overfitting, CV is being used (crossvalidation) with 5 splits, dividing the whole training dataset
into 5 parts, followed by different training and validation
data partitions with divergent R squares, which will then be
averaged to calculate the final R square value.

_C. LatencyModelTrain Layer_

Three models, namely, random forest, XGBoost, and linear
regression, were trained on the dataset. The random forest
consists of tree-like structures in which every node shows a test
on an attribute, every branch shows the answer to the test, and


-----

Fig. 1: System model


every leaf node shows a numeric value in regression. Secondly,
the XGBoost is an advanced part of gradient boosting, in
which many weak learners are combined to generate a strong
learner. In this way, the errors of each model can be corrected
sequentially. It works on a specific function that needs to
be reduced during training. In regression, the main goal is
to reduce MSE. Linear regression is a method that consists
of one target variable with multiple features. It is the most
commonly used technique in machine learning. In the case of
multiple-featured linear regression, it can be represented by a
hyperplane.
Regularization prevents over-fitting, making the coefficient
of less important features zero and facilitating feature
selection. Regularization also helps the ML model not to be
highly influenced by the outliers, and specifically, elasticnet regularization helps in flexibility and adaptability as it
combines both Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization.
Eventually, implemented all these techniques to prevent
overfitting and trained all the models again; additionally
identified the R-square and RMSE values of the models.

improved (e.g., MSE for linear regression))
_λ1 and λ1 are the regularization parameters._

between Lasso and Ridge regularization.

_D. Communication managerial layer_

Once the regression models train the data, the
communication managerial layer will be introduced, which
describes how the data will be further transmitted to other
entities. A network topology connecting vehicles, base
stations, infrastructure, servers, and pedestrians is established
for the communication process. The connection is established




_α_








 [1]2 [(1][ −] _[α][)]_







between two entities considering various factors such as
distance, signal strength, throughput, etc., which can be either
a point-to-point or a hop-to-hop connection. The network
topology helps route the data from one source vehicle to the
destination point.
The most significant segment of the task involves sorting
out the path with the least congestion and which has the
shortest distance during routing. This model continuously
analyzes and elucidates the real-time data, thus efficiently
monitoring and achieving the aforementioned task. Once the
path is selected, the packet is sent through it and continuously
monitored to see if it follows it. The security of data is a
crucial aspect of the transmitting process. If any cyber attacks
on data occur during the process, the monitoring device can
detect them and also send alerts to them.
In V2X communication, secured transmission is the
supreme criterion; to achieve it, the data should be transferred
at low latency and the communication should be reliable. For
this purpose, a latency monitoring dashboard is maintained,
ensuring the data gets transferred at a very low latency. It

can also help make proactive decisions by analyzing the

analyzing the dashboard data, it incorporates changes such as

component, updates in the traffic, etc.

In Fig. 2, scree plots are plotted about Principal Component
Analysis (PCA). It determines the main features that affect the
target variable (latency) the most. A scatter plot gives data
about insignificant features and helps to reduce them.
Fig. 3 visualizes the R-square and RMSE values for the
various models utilized. The graphs show that the correlation
coefficient, r-square value, is consistently rising, approaching
1. As explained above, the closer to 1 value of R-square is
better. Also, graphs indicate the RMSE values for each model,
and as it continuously decreases, it shows that the error is lower
and the model is better.

model.

will use the evaluation method of RMSE, which provides an
indicator for the difference between the predicted and actual
values of the target variable. RMSE is an error, so if there is
any non-zero difference, that would be calculated, and a mean
would be taken of these differences. The square root of that
mean would be the final value of the RMSE. Eq. 13 is about
the RMSE [11].

�Ni=1[(][P][i][ −] _[P][ ′]i_ [)][2]
_R[2]_ = 1 − �Ni=1[(][P][i][ −] _[P][¯][)][2]_ (14)

where,
_Pi[′]_ [is the mean value of the predicted values.]
_Pi is the predicted value of the target variable for the ith data_
point.
_P¯i is the mean value of the target variable._
The R-square value is beneficial in comparing each model
by providing a standardized measurement of how well the data
fits. Eq. 14 is the R square formula, which balances model
simplicity and explanative potency [12].
Choose the prediction’s R-square and RMSE values rather
than the MSE, MAE, or MAPE. RMSE gives an error metric
in equal units as the target variable, making it more preferable
and interpretable. MSE is more applicable for model training
optimization as it gives gradients but may not ease error
interpretation. RMSE is better than MAE because MAE doesn’t
give any insights into error distribution and is also not sensitive
to deviations like RMSE. For R-square and adjusted R-square,
R-square directly measures how well the features other than
the target variable explain the variability of the target variable.
On the other hand, adjusted R-square takes the number of
predictors in the model and removes the inclusion of nonrelevant variables that do not enhance the model’s performance.
Finally, for these reasons, RMSE and R-square values are easier
to find and use to check the model’s effectiveness.
The reason behind opting for the XGBoost is that it fits
the dataset perfectly with the values of 0.9292 and 0.000533
for Vodafone infrastructure, and it doesn’t show overfitting.
Linear regression and random forest fit the dataset well.
However, a closer-to-unity R-squared value demonstrates that
the independent variables explain a larger proportion of the
variance in the target variable. As a result, a higher R-squared
value shows better predictive performance, which indicates that
the model records more of the underlying patterns in the data.
In regression, R-squared measures the variance in the target
variable that is predictable from the independent variables, and
for those reasons, the XGBoost is chosen.
Fig 4. shows the operators’ latency distribution graph. This
bar graph shows that operator 1 has a higher frequency at lower
latency values, whereas operator 2 has a higher frequency at
higher latency values. This concludes that operator 1 has better
performance.

V. CONCLUSION

This paper concludes that link selection is important for
applications such as collision avoidance, which makes traffic
flow smoother. It helps in traffic management, prevents roadside


accidents on time or before time, and aids in a quick response
process. For the link selection process for V2X communication,
latency as a criterion is selected, and it is trained concerning the
other features affecting the communication. For this approach,
the data has been trained using different models like linear
regression, random forest, and XGBoost. Among all these
models, XGBoost performs the best by giving values of Rsquare 0.9292 and RMSE 0.000533. On further examination
of the values of latency, it can be observed that a lower value
of latency shows better performance; therefore, it leads to faster
data transmission and diminishes the communication delay, and
additional work can be done to facilitate more features under
consideration to optimize the model further.
The future scope of this research lies in extending the
potential of the study to diverse environments and adapting
to dynamic situations such as the unavailability of complete
data, traffic patterns of urban and rural areas, and infrastructure
designs. Applying furtherance increases the reliability, safety,
and productivity of V2X communication, which eventually
contributes to modern Internet communication.
