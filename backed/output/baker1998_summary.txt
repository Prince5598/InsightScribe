A research team investigating the I1307K variant of the _APC_ gene as a potential colorectal cancer risk factor stumbled upon an unforeseen complication while developing a PCR-based diagnostic assay.  Their strategy involved a mismatched primer designed to introduce an _Mse_ I restriction enzyme site specifically within the amplified wild-type sequence, a site that would be absent in the I1307K variant.  Surprisingly, complete digestion with _Mse_ I proved elusive even under optimized PCR conditions, despite generating a substantial amount of PCR product.  Sequencing analysis revealed the absence of the I1307K variant and pointed towards a single nucleotide loop-out phenomenon occurring in the template DNA during PCR amplification. This loop-out effectively allowed the mismatched primer to bind correctly, resulting in the generation of an unintended PCR product containing the engineered _Mse_ I site.  Interestingly, this artifact was less pronounced at lower magnesium concentrations, where the intended PCR product, susceptible to _Mse_ I digestion, was predominantly observed. This observation underscores the influence of magnesium concentration on product sequence and yield in PCR reactions involving mismatched primers. The study highlights the potential for mismatched primers to generate unintended products due to template or primer nucleotide looping, a phenomenon that can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of PCR-based assays.  While initially obstructing the development of their diagnostic assay, this unexpected finding prompted the researchers to shift their focus towards understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of this intriguing PCR artifact.  The sequence context surrounding the mismatch site, characterized by three consecutive thymidines, likely facilitated the formation of the single nucleotide loop-out.  This suggests that specific sequence contexts might be more prone to such misalignment artifacts.  Consequently, researchers employing mismatched primers for site-directed mutagenesis or allele-specific amplification should carefully consider the potential for misalignment and its impact on their results.  The researchers ultimately abandoned their initial diagnostic assay development pathway to pursue a deeper investigation into the mechanistic basis of this PCR artifact.  The discovery that manipulating magnesium concentrations could potentially modulate the effects of misalignment adds another layer of complexity to PCR optimization.  This finding provides valuable insights for researchers utilizing similar PCR-based methodologies and emphasizes the importance of carefully optimizing reaction conditions, including magnesium concentration, to minimize the occurrence of unintended products arising from primer-template misalignment.  The study serves as a cautionary tale and a valuable learning experience for the scientific community, emphasizing the need for meticulous primer design and thorough characterization of PCR products when employing mismatched primers.  By shedding light on the potential pitfalls associated with mismatched primers, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of PCR and its applications in molecular biology and diagnostics.  The ability to modulate the impact of misalignment through magnesium concentration manipulation presents an opportunity for fine-tuning PCR reactions and improving the accuracy of allele-specific amplification and site-directed mutagenesis strategies.  The researchers' decision to prioritize the investigation of this PCR artifact underscores the importance of pursuing unexpected findings, as they can often lead to valuable discoveries and a deeper understanding of fundamental biological processes.  The study serves as a reminder that even seemingly straightforward techniques like PCR can harbor unexpected complexities, highlighting the importance of rigorous experimental design and careful interpretation of results.
