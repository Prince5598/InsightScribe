**1. Introduction**


#### A B S T R A C T

The Corona virus outbreak sped up the process of digitalizing healthcare. The ubiquity of IoT devices in
healthcare has thrust the Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT) to the forefront as a viable answer to the
shortage of healthcare professionals. However, the medical field’s ability to utilize this technology may be
constrained by rules governing the sharing of data and privacy issues. Furthermore, endangering human life
is what happens when a medical machine learning system is tricked or hacked. As a result, robust protections
against cyberattacks are essential in the medical sector. This research uses two technologies, namely federated
learning and blockchain, to solve these problems. The ultimate goal is to construct a trusted federated learning
system on the blockchain that can predict people who are at risk for developing diabetes. The study’s findings
were deemed satisfactory as it achieved a multilayer perceptron accuracy of 97.11% and an average federated
learning accuracy of 93.95%.


Since its formal proposal in 1956 [1], Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
been steadily and rapidly proliferating itself in everyday life. It comes to
consolidate human efforts to face challenging issues and solve problems
of humanity. As it is expanding its spheres into many different areas,
AI is indeed a crucial support system for the development of society.
Taking advantage of the vast amount of data produced across the
world and the significant advancements in hardware technology, the
field of Machine Learning (ML) has advanced to the point where a
number of intelligent systems built on ML models are beginning to find
their way into mainstream applications leveraged in performing day-today human tasks [2]. This progress is extremely beneficial and valuable
since it enhances people achieve higher efficiency and productivity.
There is a wide range of uses for machine learning, from simple
applications like recommender systems [3] used by information-based
companies like Google, Twitter, Netflix, and LinkedIn to sophisticated
applications like self-driving cars [4], smart healthcare [5], earthquake
prediction [6], and many more [7]. One sector that has greatly benefited from these technological advancements is the healthcare sector.
Machine learning has shown remarkable applicability in the medical
field, revolutionizing healthcare practices and patient outcomes [8,9].


More importantly, smart healthcare systems have opened up virtually
unbelievable prospects and novel possibilities for saving lives. Their
potential lies in their ability to analyze vast amounts of patient data,
identify patterns, and generate insights that aid in accurate diagnoses
and treatment planning. HIoT enables a tremendous change in the field
of digital health, as evidenced by the findings of the study by Habib
Zadeh and colleagues from 2019 [10]. By deploying a wide range of
intelligent systems, it aspires to offer consistent medical attention to
patients. Thus, it is an essential part of keeping people alive. Research
interest in the domain of HIoT is therefore growing at an exponential
rate.
However, being impressed by the humongous opportunities that AI
offers for a smarter life should not lead to undermining the serious
risks that it poses. The need to shed light and get insights into the
associated risks with AI and ML is emerging. In fact, patient confidentiality is of utmost importance, and the aggregation of sensitive
medical information raises concerns about data breaches, unauthorized
access, and potential misuse. Medical data contains highly sensitive
and personal information about patients, including their medical history, diagnoses, treatments, and genetic information. Any unauthorized
access to or disclosure of this data can lead to severe consequences

for the individuals involved, including identity theft, discrimination,
or social stigmatization. The medical field could be a prime target for
cyberattacks due to the value of medical data on the black market.
Privacy breaches resulting from cyberattacks can lead to significant
harm to individuals and organizations.

Though ML models have been established to outperform well across
a diverse range of tasks, they are also susceptible to adversarial attacks [11]. The latter category attempts to trick an ML model into
failing in a variety of ways, leading to misclassified results. The attacker
in a black-box attack does not have access to or knowledge of the
model’s internal settings. A white-box exploit, on the other hand, allows
the attacker complete access to all model parameters, allowing for
significant alterations to the model’s architecture and, by extension,
its outcomes. If the health-related ML model is tricked, it will lead to
misclassified results that put lives at risk.

Given the aforementioned reservations, academics, researchers, and
stakeholders are battling with the difficult challenge of how to develop a trusted AI [12]. While using IT solutions in healthcare saves
lives, it also raises a number of concerns, particularly in the areas of
privacy and security. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information must be safeguarded to prevent unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, interruption, alteration, or destruction, as defined by [13].
Nevertheless, privacy safeguards ensure that users’ information is handled in line with their preferences when it is collected, stored, utilized,
and disseminated. Data privacy means being in charge of one’s own
information. However, security is tied to safety. It is the process of protecting data against various vulnerabilities. Security is often compared
to a game of chess, and as such, it is important to not only develop
a successful strategy but also to anticipate potential threats from the
adversary and their possible responses.

Striking a balance between leveraging the power of machine learning while ensuring stringent privacy protection measures is crucial
to foster trust and encourage further advancements in the medical
domain. Therefore, researchers are always working on finding new approaches to reinforce ML’s robustness in the face of the ongoing conflict
between ML and attack vectors. They take advantage of the state of
the art and cutting-edge technologies to develop formidable defenses.
Some of the most promising alternatives include federated learning (FL)
and blockchain technology. FL, as an emerging shift in ML paradigms,
comes with promises to preserve privacy. Instead of sending data to
a model, this approach reverses the process and brings the model to
the data. The blockchain is yet another effective new innovation. Its
robust features, ensuring both content and operations security, make it
a potential solution for combating malicious attacks. Driven by privacy
and security concerns, this research tries to consolidate efforts for a
more secure and efficient smart healthcare [14]. The primary goal is
to construct a secure and private decentralized learning platform using
blockchain technology-concisely, a blockchain-based federated learning
system that ensures privacy preservation and data integrity.

_1.1. Research contributions of this work_

In order to reach the main goal of this study, two main objectives
have been set:

1. To build an ML system based on FL in order to guarantee privacy

preservation.
2. To integrate blockchain technology into the FL system to ensure

ML model integrity and immunize the system against attacks.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the background of the study. Section 3 outlines an overview of the related work.
The proposed framework to solve the addressed problem is presented in
Section 4. The experiments and the results are presented in Section 5.
The achieved results are discussed in Section 6. Section 7 presents the
threats to validity. The conclusion is given in the last section of the
paper.


**2. Background study**

This section is subdivided into three subsections. First, we present
an overview on the HIoT, secondly the FL and finally the Blockchain
technology.

_2.1. Healthcare internet of things (HIoT)_

The World Human Organization (WHO) Constitution envisages ‘‘the
_highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human_
_being.’’[1]_ With an ageing global population, rising life expectancy, and
the emergence of new diseases, it is imperative that healthcare evolve
to be more proactive rather than reactive – that is – preventive than
curative.

Health has a significant impact on a country’s economic development. People who live longer and healthier lives tend to contribute
more to society as a whole. As a result, the healthcare sector is consistently innovating in order to fulfill this fundamental human right.

The healthcare sector has always benefited from technological advancements. This helped bring forward a novel outlook to medical
care. Now, instead of patients going to get care, it is the healthcare
providers that go to the patients. Currently, we talk of electronic health
(e-Health) [15].

Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the main technologies enabling sustainable healthcare delivery, which is important since putting healthcare services out of reach of regular people puts their lives at risk.
IoT has slowly proliferated itself in healthcare. However, pre-Pandemic
conditions have altered a lot of situations following the COVID-19
pandemic. The need for continuously available (always-on) healthcare
services and the social distancing led to a dramatic transition in IoT
deployment in healthcare. The technology was hugely applicable to
tackle the pandemic. Combating the epidemic would benefit greatly
from this technology. In many health systems, for instance, the global
number of online consults has increased by a factor of 50 to 100
due to the usage of telehealth and telemedicine to improve healthcare
solutions and to remotely treat patients [16,17]. In light of the recent
coronavirus outbreak, Dr. Peter Gocke, Chief Digital Officer at Charite
University Medical Center in Berlin, has stated that ‘‘we need more open
_and transparent communication to change structures and processes that are_
_no longer working’’._

In the following three subsections, we will discuss typical uses
for HIoT, security and privacy concerns with HIoT deployment, and
security architecture to solve these issues.

_2.1.1. HIoT applications_

IoT devices help in patients’ surveillance [18]. In nursing homes and
hospitals, they help keep tabs on residents’ health. They help disabled
persons who live alone by keeping an eye on vitals like heart rate and
blood pressure, among other things. Medical Fridges, Fall Detection,
Dental are other applications of IoT based healthcare systems [19].
In 2019, 86% of healthcare providers used IoT in some capacity.
Forbes predicts that by 2020, 646 million IoT devices will be in use in
healthcare facilities such as hospitals, clinics, and doctors’ offices [20].
HIoT can be used in a variety of contexts. Here we highlight some of
the most popular uses of HIoT [10,19]:

  - Blood Glucose Monitoring: A diabetic patient needs to keep a

close eye on their blood glucose levels. It provides advice on how
to cope with the illness. Warnings and useful recommendations
can be issued by IoT devices in potentially harmful Warnings
and useful recommendations can be issued by IoT devices in
potentially harmful

Cloud threats and their descriptions.

Threat Description

Malicious Insider Someone from the inside having access to user’s data may
manipulate it.
Data Loss A malicious user with an unauthorized access may alter or
delete the existing data.
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) A kind of Account Hijacking threat. The attacker can alter or
intercept messages in the communication between two
parties.
Cloud Storage Data Exfiltration Sensitive data is viewed, used or stolen by someone outside
of the organization’s environment.
GANs-based Inference Attacks Generative Adversarial Network-based attacks launch
inference and poisoning attacks.
Communication bottlenecks The communication bandwidth gets weaker and drastically
disrupts the FL process.
Backdoor attack Injecting malicious task into the current model without
affecting its actual accuracy.
Organized crime and hackers Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups target thieving to
data acquisition.



  - Cardiac Monitoring: The mortality rate from cardiovascular dis
ease can be reduced with the use of continuous cardiac monitoring, according to a recent study cited in the journal Zagan 2017
Healthcare [21]. IoT devices aid in monitoring of hypertension
and hypotension [22].

  - Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) Monitoring: An AD patient needs

round-the-clock care. Using IoT devices, caregivers can perform
things like track a patient’s whereabouts and receive alerts about
unusual behavior [23].

  - Medical Fridges: IoT systems are used to control internal condi
tions in freezers where medicines, vaccines and organic elements
are stored [24].

  - Fall Detection: Detecting falls is a major concern for the elderly

and the crippled who live alone, and here is where IoT solutions
shine [25].

  - Dentistry: Internet of Things is also used in dentistry. Blue
tooth connected toothbrush analyzes the brushing uses and gives
information on the brushing habits for personal use or for dentists [26].

_2.1.2. Security and privacy challenges_

HIoT has greatly simplified our daily life. However, widespread
adoption is unlikely because of concerns over the security and privacy
of user data. In fact, people almost feel uncomfortable with sharing
personal medical data. These concerns are raised with HIoT devices’
susceptibility to attacks. Some of these security issues are as follows

[27]:

 - Unauthorized Access to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID):

Unauthorized RFID access is a key problem in the Internet of
Things. If someone has access to the user’s identification tag, it
could compromise their privacy. The tag can be read, changed, and
possibly even broken [27].

 - Sensor-Nodes Security Breach: A sensor node’s primary function

is to act as a data collector and transmitter. As part of a two-way
sensor network, it can sometimes collect and relay information. It
is also possible to get data. That could make the node vulnerable
to outside attackers. Intruders can either steal or tamper with
node data. The attacks of jamming, tampering, Sybil, and flooding,
among others, are summarized by [28].

 - Cloud Computing Abuse: The cloud-centric architecture exposes

IoT systems to several threats. For example, if an attacker gets
access to the server, it can upload any malicious software and get
control on the connected devices. Table 1 summarizes some of
these serious threats [27,29,30].


_2.1.3. Security architecture_

Regarding the previously mentioned challenges, establishing a security architecture becomes an increasing need to ensure HIoT efficiency.
Several actions could be taken in different levels to face such challenges. In general, security architecture contains three levels [20] as
presents Fig. 1:

  - Device security (perception layer): At this level, the threat is

physical. It attacks the physical devices. The protection should
then target the device itself.

  - Communication securities (Network and transport layer): It

aims to protect network and communication.

  - Cloud security (Application layer): It aims to protect the data

itself against threats of different natures.

_2.2. Federated learning_

Coined by Google in 2016 and referred to as Vanilla FL, the FL
aims to generate ML models from distributed datasets on various devices. It came with promises to protect data privacy. And since, it is
experiencing a great growth in both academia and industry. Privacy
and security are among the essential objectives of FL. FL allows private
data to remain under the control of its owner. It is built on the idea
of bringing the model to the data, but it goes beyond that. It allows
benefiting from peers’ experiences. In a FL system, there are two
principal actors [31,32] as below:

  - Server: it orchestrates the training process and updates the learn
ing model without getting access to the client data.

  - Client: each client holds its own data, trains the model locally

and shares the updates with the others via server.

The number of clients participating in the learning process is variable. However, there is usually only one server.

The following parts present the FL life cycle and the challenges it
faces.

_2.2.1. Federated learning life cycle_

From the baseline model to the final model, the FL life cycle goes
through several steps. According to [33], a FL process is composed
of continuous communication rounds between the server and the end
devices. It is completed once the desired accuracy or the fixed number
of rounds are reached.

First, the server generates a generic model then each round follows
these steps as presented in Fig. 2:

1. The server selects a subset of clients and sends them the generic

model.


-----

**Fig. 1. Security architecture: Levels and descriptions.**

**Fig. 2. Federated learning life cycle, continuous communication rounds.**


2. The selected clients download the current model parameters and
initialize the local model with such parameters.
3. Each client trains the model on its own local data. At the end of
the training, it updates and optimizes the model parameters.
4. The clients send the optimized new parameters to the server.
5. Based on an aggregation algorithm, the server aggregates the
clients’ updates. The global model is updated with the new
aggregated parameters.

The updated model is sent back to the selected clients. A new round
takes place until getting the final model [34].

_2.2.2. Challenges_
FL’s primary guarantee is the protection of user privacy. Consequently, impressive results are being shown in that setting. On the other
hand, it has a number of problems that need addressing [33].

  - Non-Independent and Non-Identically Distributed (Non-IID)
**Data: Each customer base is unique, and as such, each client has**
its own experience. The generated dataset is, therefore, dependent
on its personal behavior. The same device may be used by different people. That makes the dataset not representative and even
non-identically distributed from one device to another [35].

  - Unbalanced Data: Dataset sizes might vary widely from one
device to another because of the diverse range of ways in which
devices are put to use. The effectiveness of the outcomes is reliant
on the quality of the training dataset [28]. Thus, it is important
to consider the size of each client’s dataset when performing an
efficient aggregate.

   - **Massively Distributed Data: Smartphones, Internet of Things**
(IoT) devices, automobiles, institutions, and many others are all


examples of the kinds of clients that can take part in a FL process.
Due to this, there is a great deal of variation in the statistics,
leading to highly distributed data [33].

- Unreliable Device Connection: A client’s accessibility is tied to
its network connectivity. If a client has a poor or slow connection,
they may be unable to take part in the communication round.
There could be a drop in the performance of the model as a result
of that, affecting the model’s efficiency [33].

- Limited Device Memory: Devices differ in their computational
capacities and amounts of available memory. It is likely that
a smartphone or IoT device has less storage space than other
gadgets [33].

- Single point failure: FL depends on a centralized server to
aggregate model updates. This aggregator could be the target of
an attack. In addition, a volume of data transmitted to the server
simultaneously may overwhelm its capabilities [36].

- Privacy leakage:. Substantial information may be gleaned from
intermediate updates via inference attacks. It is also possible for
a hostile server to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
to steal private information [37].

- Lack of motivation:In order for FL to work, it is assumed that
all nearby devices are willing to take part in the training process and share their experience. Unfortunately, that cannot be
accomplished. Some nodes may choose not to take part in the poll
for various reasons, such as a preference for privacy, a dearth of
computing resources, or even just plain selfishness etc [33].

- Poisoning Attacks: FL guarantees the safety, security, preservation, and integrity of your data. However, attacks involving
poison are always a concern. They pose a risk to system security
and can originate either from the server or the client side [38].


-----

Different techniques were associated to FL to deal with privacy
issues: – Homomorphic encryption: it is an encryption technique that
allows computing encrypted data, without the need to decrypt it. Data
could be used without revealing its content, and even the results of its
manipulation remain encrypted [39,40]. – Secure aggregate (SecAgg):
it consists to encrypt the model updates from each participating device
before sending them to the central server. The server then uses a
‘‘secure multiparty computation’’ technique to aggregate the encrypted
updates without decrypting them [30,39,41]. – Differential Privacy: it
consists of injecting a carefully chosen amount of noise into the data
without loosing its utility. That makes it hard to infer and, at the same
time, ensures getting significant results [39].
One other candidate solution to address these privacy concerns
and other FL issues such as single point failure is Blockchain technology [42], which can help users maximize the advantages of FL. In the
next section, we will dive deeper into blockchain.

_2.3. Blockchain_

There is no single, comprehensive description of what blockchain
actually is. There are other comparable definitions in the literature.
Thus, the literature provides various but similar definitions. The term
‘‘Blockchain’’ is self-explanatory. It consists of blocks connected to each
other. Blockchain allows data storage using consensus algorithms to
generate and update the distributed ledger, and encryption to ensure
security during transmission [43].
Blockchain, as defined by [44], is a decentralized ledger that records
transactions between users independently. It is a distributed database
without a central authority. It manages the flow of information between
nodes in a peer-to-peer network. It is impossible to delete information
once it has been transferred. Data transfer is irreversible. The following subsections outline the Blockchain characteristics, the components
leading to these firm characteristics, and two vital technologies that
Blockchain relies on and owes its growth to.

_2.3.1. Blockchain characteristics_
Blockchain robust features make it an attractive option for protecting the integrity and privacy of sensitive information [45]:

  - Decentralization: Blockchain operates as a distributed ledger
system. There is no central authority to control transactions.
Unlike a centralized architecture, a transaction can be conducted
between any two nodes without the intervention of a third,
trusted party. That helps to avoid the single point failure problem
typical of server-based architecture [45].

  - Transparency: Blockchain transactions are broadcast to all participating nodes. Thus, all participating nodes can freely access
them. Any node can have an overview on the recorded transactions [45].

  - Immutability and Traceability: Once a transaction is validated
and stored in the ledger, it cannot be modified unless a node has
control on over 51% of the nodes. To trace previous records, it
just needs to access any node in the network and consult the
associated ledger [45].

  - De-Trusting: In Blockchain, a user’s identity need not be revealed
in order to connect with other nodes. The nodes in a peer-to-peer
(P2P) network are not required to trust each other to validate
transactions. Instead, the trust comes from the adopted consensus
algorithms. The latter control the communication between nodes
and ensure that the distributed ledgers are the same [45].

  - Anonymity: A user can interact with other nodes in Blockchain
without revealing its identity. It is identified by a randomly
generated address [45].


**Fig. 3. Blockchain components and their interactions.**

_2.3.2. Blockchain components_
Blockchain owes its firm characteristics to its different components
which interact to ensure a secure data sharing as Fig. 3 shows.

  - Transactions: Blockchain enables sharing information between
the different nodes among a P2P network. The source node generates a file containing the exchange information. Then, it broadcasts it to the entire network for validation. A set of validated
transactions is congregated in blocks. The first generated block
is called Genesis Block. Each transaction changes the Blockchain
state. Each node holds a log containing the history of previous
transactions.

  - Secured Distributed Ledger: The history of validated transactions is recorded in a Ledger. A block generated is broadcasted for
validation. Once a block is validated, it is queued to the precedent
blocks forming, then, a chain [46].

  - Asymmetric key Cryptography: To achieve security, Blockchain
relies on two types of cryptography and Hash Function:
**Hash Function: A hash function is a cryptographic implementa-**
tion of a hash algorithm. It is a way to apply a hash algorithm to
an input. Its result is known as a message digest. It has a unique
fixed-size. Blockchain uses the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). Its
size is 256 bits (SHA-256). This is a one-way hashing function.
In most cases, the digest message cannot be used to reconstruct
the original message. Finding an input that provides a certain
message digest is similarly challenging. Two distinct inputs will
never provide the same hash value [47,48].
**Asymmetric Encryption: Public-key encryption is another name**
for asymmetric encryption. There are two keys needed to encrypt
and decrypt any message. It has two main applications: addresses
and electronic signatures. A node must have a wallet inside the
P2P network to conduct any transaction. This wallet is protected
by the private key, while its address uses the public key [47,49].

  - Consensus Mechanism: Unreliable nodes in a P2P network require a consensus method. Thus, the P2P distributed network
necessitates a mechanism to reach consensus between the untrustworthy nodes. Several consensus algorithms are used to control
communication and ensure that ledgers in different nodes are
consistent: Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), Delegated Proof of Stake
(DPoS) etc [45,50]. Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of
each algorithm.

_2.3.3. Blockchain technologies_

The Blockchain growth is mainly due to the advanced technologies
it deploys. Smart Contracts and Hyperledger are two vital technologies
adopted by Blockchain.

  - Smart Contract : The term ‘‘smart contract’’, or ‘‘SC’’, was coined

by Nich Szabo in 1994. A SC is a code block that executes itself
when certain conditions are satisfied [51]. Launched in 2015, it
is the first of its kind to be used in the Ethereum Blockchain. It is
difficult to make adjustments to a SC after it has been put into production. SCs are crucial for establishing connections — basically
setting and getting data to and from the distributed ledger [43]. In
spite of their promising appearance in the future, SCs are not yet
capable of functioning independently as a decentralized server.

  - Hyper Ledger : Hyperledger is an umbrella term for a col
lection of Linux Foundation-sponsored open-source initiatives.
These projects are used for Blockchain development. Hyperledger
differs from permissionless Blockchain systems like Ethereum
since it is generally private and permissionless. It serves as a
‘‘greenhouse’’ that promotes collaboration between businesses
and developers [52].

**3. Related work**

Blockchain-based federated learning (BCFL) has been employed in
several fields. Industrial IoT, medicine, Internet of vehicles are some of
BCFL applications. The different applications of BCFL in medicine are
presented as follows.

To face covid-19 crisis, the work of [53] used a Blockchain managed
FL approach. It allows detecting the Corona virus from symptoms. The
proposed approach relies on two modules: An immunization model
based on Deep Learning algorithms [54,55]. It detects covid-19 from
symptoms data such as loss of smell and taste, fever, vomiting, cough,
shortness of breath. A biometric module using neural network architecture is used for face recognition. A set of HIoT sensors are used to
collect data [56]. The two modules coupled with an AI-based QR code
generator produce a Blockchain mapped health immunization certificate. The system that allows a dynamic health QR code visualization
has applications for three actors: the patient, the health authority and
the stakeholders wherever health status must be checked for safety.
The transactions through the whole system are stored in Blockchain.
The private raw data is stored off-chain in the InterPlanetary File
System (IPFS) repository. The training data hash is then stored in the
Blockchain. Two types of Blockchain were deployed. Ethereum and
Hyperledger were used to manage the distributed ledger system. The
system added security and privacy algorithm to FL ecosystem. It aims
to find a balance between the model accuracy and the privacy budget.

The authors of [57] proposed a method to help medical practitioners
to detect Covid-19 using lung Computed Tomography (CT) scans. The
architecture relied on a Modified Capsule Network for Covid-19 subjects’ classification. The dataset contained 34,006 CT images belonging
to 89 persons, 68 among them were diagnosed as positive and the other
21 were diagnosed as negative cases.

In [58], the authors proposed a BCFL approach to predict diabetes.
An Artificial Neural Network model was trained on Pima Indians Diabetes Database provided by the American National Institute of Diabetes
and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The dataset was distributed among


15 participants in a randomized way to simulate a federation scenario.
SCs in an Ethereum Blockchain were used instead of a centralized
aggregator. They collect model updates (weights and biases) from
the nodes participating in the training and send them the aggregated
parameters to update their models. The model was trained in different
circumstances. The average accuracy of the model is 73% (against 76%
in a centralized architecture). The developed model is partially secure.
Inference attacks are still possible. Privacy preserving protocols can be
used to improve the model performance.

The work of [59] proposed a BCFL approach for smart healthcare
based on Medical Internet of Things (MIoT). It aims to resist to the single point failure problem, to protect data privacy and detect poisoning
attacks. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on Pima
Indians Diabetes Database to generate a diabetic prediction model. A
small Blockchain prototype based on Ethereum was used to store, verify
and share the model updates. Inference attacks are still possible, an
extra layer of security was added to the system architecture. Privacy
preserving methods were used to guarantee data privacy: Adaptive
Differential Privacy and an efficient consensus protocol based on gradient verification. Differential privacy technology consists of adding a
suitable noise to the updated model parameters to prohibit inference
attacks. Gradient verification detects and filters malicious gradients
injected into aggregation process. The model accuracy reaches 84%.
It helps to reduce the privacy budget consumption and to resist to
poisoning attacks. However, an unsuitable added noise may increase
computing resources consumption to extract the original data.

[60] presented a FL method that uses Blockchain for a decentralized
data management. The model purpose is to detect tuberculosis infection
in a privacy preserving environment. A CNN model was trained on
respectively 50, 70, 90, 110 X-ray images coming from MIoT devices.
Blockchain was used to share model updates. The results showed that
classifier effectiveness depends on the number of samples used for
the training. The accuracy increased with an important number of
samples and reached 75%. However, privacy preserving measures are
still needed to be taken to ameliorate the classifier performance.

The work of [61] used a blockchain-based federated learning approach to remotely monitor patients’ health using medical internet
of things (MIOT). The model used a source data called Fitbit. The
blockchain provided a secure sharing of patient health records. However, running a blockchain transaction network on a small device is
challenging due to its high processing and bandwidth requirements.

Table 3 provides a summary of BCFL applications in medical field.

**4. Proposed approach**

To fulfill the previously announced objectives, the research’s framework is divided into three main phases. As shown in Fig. 4 each phase’s
output is the input of the next phase.

_4.1. Phase one: Dataset selection_

Security and privacy are main objectives of this research. Medical
field is one of the domains necessitating privacy preservation and
high security. Therefore, Pima Indians Diabetes, a medical dataset,
was used to implement the study. Pima dataset is originally from
the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
Based on diagnostic measurements, it is used to predict whether a

patient is diabetic or not. It holds 768 labeled records of 21 or older
females. It is composed of several medical predictor variables and one
target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables consist of the number of
pregnancies the patient has had, her Body Mass Index (BMI), Insulin
level, age, and so on. A dataset summary description is provided in
Table 4. The selected dataset is then replicated into two copies for the
next framework execution phase.

_4.2. Phase two: ML and blockchain integration_

At this stage, three processes take place: centralized ML, FL and
Blockchain integration.

_4.2.1. Centralized ML_
The dataset is a labeled dataset that traits a classification problem.
Therefore, the ML model used in this study is a classifier model: a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. MLP is a deep learning model. It
is a feedforward Neural Network type [62]. It is composed of nodes
organized into numerous layers to make prediction conclusions [63].


_4.2.2. Federated learning_
In a FL process, each client trains the model locally with its own
data. The data is gathered by IoT sensors to monitor medical variables
measurements such as Insulin level, blood pressure, Glucose level and
so on. Based on these variables, the model predicts whether the person
is diabetic or not. To simulate HIoT data, we divided the initial dataset
into two partial datasets. Each dataset is associated to a client. The two
datasets are, consequently, homogeneous and have the same features.
The MLP training is, then, federated across two clients over the selected
datasets and takes two rounds. Despite the fact that FL protects privacy,
it could be subject to attacks at different levels: at the server side,
between client and server, and at the client side. In order to secure
the FL against attacks, Blockchain is used to protect it.

_4.2.3. Blockchain integration_
Instead of using a centralized server to manage the FL process, the
study deploys Blockchain technology. A malicious server could alter
model parameters and falsify the aggregation . Thus, Blockchain is

used to immunize model parameters against attacks. The aggregation
process is implemented in a SC. The SC receives the parameters of the
model from the distributed ledgers, aggregates them and sends them
back to the clients’ associated ledgers. The Blockchain-based Federated
Learning implementation steps are presented in Fig. 5

_4.3. Phase three: Evaluation_

At the end of previous steps, the results of all experiments are
collected and analyzed. Different performance measurements are used
to evaluate the model. At this final phase of the research framework,
the performances of the different processes are evaluated based on
Accuracy, Precision and Recall.

  - TN = True Negative

  - FP = False Positive

**Accuracy: It describes the ratio of correctly predicted results among**
all results. It tells how good the model was overall.

**Recall: Called also Sensitivity, it describes the ratio of correctly**
predicted positive results among true positive results. Recall is most
important in medical field. In fact, not only we need to treat the correctly positive results, but also cover the incorrectly predicted negative
results. Therefore, the Recall must be of high value to classify the model
as efficient.

**5. Experiment and results**

This section is divided into two subsections. The first subsection
describes the selected dataset and the ML model used in this research.
The second subsection outlines the results achieved along this study.

_5.1. Experiment_

This subsection describes the selected dataset and the ML model
used in this research. It also provides a description of the FL process
and the Blockchain integration.

  - Dataset Selection and Preparation:
Pima Indians Diabetes dataset is used to implement the study; it
[is available at https://kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-](https://kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
[diabetes-database](https://kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
The selected dataset is replicated into two copies: Copy1, Copy2.
Copy1 is dedicated for centralized learning where Copy2 is dedicated for federated learning.

  - Centralized ML:


-----

**Fig. 7. ROC curve for MLP performance.**


The MLP used in this research is composed of a 8-dimensions
input layer, 9 hidden layers and a 1-dimension output layer.
It relies on ‘‘adam’’ optimiser and on two activation functions:
Rectifier Linear Unit (reLU) and Sigmoid. It uses K-fold crossvalidation technique, the data is partitioned into 10 subsets. The
model is trained on the first copy of the dataset (Copy1) for 20
times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and
the remaining folds as the training set. Fig. 6 describes the used
MLP model.

- Federated Learning:
To simulate IoT datasets for FL, the second copy of the dataset
Copy2 is divided into two datasets: Pima1, Pima2. The original dataset holds 768 records. If it gets divided into two equal
datasets, the model would be trained on insufficient data. Therefore, to get effective results, the dataset was not equally divided
because it is not voluminous. Pima 1 has a dataset size of 520,
while Pima 2 has a dataset size of 550. The FL process involves
two clients. It is conducted in two rounds. Each client trains the
model on its own data. By the end of the round, it sends the model
parameters back to the server for aggregation. It sends the weights
and the biases of the model. The parameters are aggregated and
sent back to clients. The model is set with the new parameters.
Then, another round takes place until reaching the determined
number of rounds.

- Blockchain Integration:
Instead of using a centralized server to control the FL process, the
study deploys Blockchain technology. SCs are used to store and
aggregate the global and the local updates. The SC receives the
parameters of the model from the distributed ledgers, aggregates
them and sends them back to the clients’ associated ledgers.
Solidity programming language is used to develop SCs. Two main

_5.2. Results_

This subsection presents the results of the research. First, it presents
the results of the centralized ML execution on the first copy of the
dataset. Then it provides the results of the FL execution on the partial
datasets. These results are then compared to evaluate their performances . Finally, it presents the results of Blockchain integration.

  - Centralized ML Results:
The first copy of the dataset was used to train a Multi-Layer
Perceptron in a centralized way. The performance of the model
was measured using the standard measurements of accuracy,
precision and recall. Table 6 summarizes the results of the model.

**Fig. 8. Pima 1 ROC curve.**

ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is another way to
measure the performance of the model. Fig. 7 depicts the ROC
curve of the model.

  - Federated Learning Results:
Pima dataset was split into two datasets: Pima1, Pima2 . The FL
process involved two clients. It took two rounds. The results of
the model during the first round on each of the two datasets
are represented in Table 7. By the end of the first round, the
model is set with the new values. A new round took place and
so on. The results of the last round are presented in Table 8. The
ROC curves of the final round on both datasets are depicted in
Figs. 8 and 9. Both ROC curves show satisfying performances.
The model performs better on the dataset ‘‘Pima2’’ than ‘‘Pima1’’.
This difference is due to the fact that ‘‘Pima2’’ is more voluminous
than Pima1". Moreover, there is a class imbalance in the datasets;
the model tends to focus more on the majority class to optimize
the overall accuracy. Consequently, it achieves high recall for
the positive class but compromises on correctly predicting the
negative class, leading to low accuracy and precision.

  - Blockchain Integration Results:
The cryptocurrency used on Ethereum is Ether (ETH). Wei is
the smallest denomination of Ether. To occur through Ethereum
network, a transaction needs to be powered by some ‘‘gas’’. The
gas price of a transaction costs Gwei. Gwei (a blend of giga and
wei) is a denomination of ETH. One ETH is equal to one billion
gwei. Table 9 shows the cost of the SC in gwei as computed by
MetaMask during implementation.

**6. Results discussion**

The findings of the research are discussed in this section. It examines
the differences between the outcomes of centralized ML and FL. These

findings are represented by three figures. The accuracy of the centralized ML and FL on both datasets is depicted in Fig. 10. The precision
of the centralized ML and FL is depicted in Fig. 11. The recall of the
centralized ML and FL can be seen in Fig. 12.
Comparing the results of centralized Learning and FL, it can be
noticed that there is not a big difference between the two. When
compared to the accuracy of the centralized ML, the average accuracy
of the FL reduced by 3.16%. The slight decrease of model performances
in FL is compensated by privacy preservation.
To evaluate the scalability of the proposed mechanism to large
[datasets, we applied it on Heart Disease Dataset, available at: http](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset?resource=download&select=heart.csv)
[s://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset?reso](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset?resource=download&select=heart.csv)
[urce=download&select=heart.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset?resource=download&select=heart.csv)

The used dataset contains 1025 records. It is composed of 14 features. The experiments show very encouraging results as the ROC curve
in Fig. 13 shows. The model achieves a centralized accuracy of 99%
and an average federated accuracy exceeding 95%. These results make
the proposed approach transferable to various medical classification
problems. It can be applied to additional classification tasks where
accurate and efficient diagnosis and privacy preservation are a concern.
Clients are encouraged to employ a secured FL model that has good
performance and a guarantee of privacy if they want their prediction requests to be fulfilled by that model. The protection of users’
privacy in FL causes a moderate drop in model’s performances but
they are still efficient. In addition to that, the implementation of
Blockchain technology brought an increased level of safety to the proposed system. It is essential that blockchain technology be integrated
into intelligent healthcare systems in order to boost patients’ trust. In
the sphere of medicine, the application of such technologies would
significantly improve the linkage of Blockchain and FL. Additional
intelligent healthcare applications may stand to gain from Blockchain’s
potentially significant contribution and see their services improved as
a result. Therefore, Clients would use the applications provided by The
HIoT without worrying about their privacy or the effectiveness of the
services provided. That would be a big help in terms of saving more
human lives and providing new prospects for a better future in terms
of e-health.
Our proposed solution is reliable enough to allow the sharing of
private medical data and the exploitation of opportunities presented
by smart healthcare. Applications for the IoT built on top of such


**Fig. 14. The figure compares the performances of the ANN approach and our approach**
performances.

intelligent systems would significantly improve the quality of life for
those living in those areas. As a consequence of this, the Blockchainbased federated learning system appears to be an ambitious solution for
the problem that has been investigated, given that it preserves users’
privacy and guarantees their safety. The work of [58] developed and
built a Blockchain-based federated learning system to predict diabetes.
It trained an ANN on the same dataset . The FL average accuracy that
it attained was 73%, which contrasts with the FL average accuracy that
our approach achieved, which was 93.95 (see Fig. 14).

**7. Threats to validity**

Some challenges and obstacles were encountered during the conduction of this study. They can be outlined as follows:
1. The technology of Blockchain and the FL are relatively new.
Applying these technologies in the medical field is still limited. That
is why finding sufficient literature was a challenge.
2. The dataset used in this study is not an IoT dataset. To simulate IoT datasets, we needed to divide the initial dataset into smaller
datasets.
3. The functionalities of SC programming languages are limited.

**8. Conclusion**

Some noteworthy achievements have been endorsed by this study.
In this paper, we systematically analyzed previous research on the


-----

subject of using FL and Blockchain in healthcare. The study revealed
that there is an increasing need for privacy and security measures in
the healthcare sector. The second goal of the study was leveraging MLP
classifier for predicting diabetes. It is essential that a medical model
have excellent performance. The proposed method outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and privacy preservation,
according to experimental results on a public diabetes dataset. The accuracy, precision, and recall of the deployed model are all outstanding.
The implemented model has a satisfying accuracy that is near the centralized model’s accuracy. In addition to that, by using Blockchain, the
aggregation process implemented in a SC was secured against attacks
and falsification. Future research could include more ML algorithms
and unsupervised learning techniques. In addition, the addition of a
sizable number of IoT datasets has the potential to significantly boost
the model’s accuracy. A more robust model can be built with more
and different types of data. Further, the FL process may use a security
approach that consists of promoting safe clients and rejecting harmful
clients from the training process in order to improve security. Further,
while it is important to point out Blockchain’s role in keeping the
system secure, the latter may be vulnerable to attacks. Moreover, we
tend to work on reducing the Blockchain high latency.
