Abstract The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up new horizons in the field
of remote health data analysis to obtain smart healthcare. However, protecting patients’ data privacy seems challenging because medical files are so sensitive. There are significant risks to data confidentiality associated with storing patient health information on third-party servers. The covid-19
epidemic also enhanced the need for a temperature sensor-based respiratory monitoring device.
Sharing electronic health records can aid with diagnostic accuracy when privacy and security protection are important system challenges. Due to the benefits of immutability, blockchain has been
suggested as a possible option to enable personal health data exchange with privacy and security
protection. This work suggests a safe and privacy-preserving diagnostic enhancement strategy for
e-Health platforms based on blockchain technology, which addresses the inadequacy of previous
work in these regards. The proposed work proposes an effective access control system that would
let data owners specify their preferred access controls over their privacy-sensitive medical data.
Users could utilize their user transactions for key generation to efficiently cancel or add authorized
doctors. Experimental data and security analyses demonstrate the proposed Health-chain’s suitability for use in smart healthcare systems. The thorough experimental investigation demonstrates the
blockchain’s effectiveness of computing and time consumption as well as its resistance to numerous
security assaults.

1. Introduction

Through significant advancements in e-health records, account
information and prescription drug data, the IoT paradigm has
transformed the healthcare industry [1]. The IoT-based medical equipment could assist in the collection of priceless patient
data, automate workflows, offer insights into the indications
and patterns of diseases, make remote care easier, and give
patients greater control over their lives and medicines [2].
Patients could be examined in real-time with IoT devices.
Additionally, they might lessen the necessity of visiting hospitals for regular health examinations. Hospital stays or readmission expenses may be decreased with the aid of connected
home health surveillance devices. Through warnings and trigger messages, IoT-enabled medical devices may assist with
diagnosis before it gets serious. Sensors attached to various
components of a patient’s clinical tool could gather information and then transmit it to the clinic, where a medicinal professional could review it for any potential anomalies. Without
a doubt, IoT advancements have sparked ongoing advances in
the healthcare industry [3]. However, since this data is dispersed throughout numerous medical facilities, securely processing the electronic healthcare record (HER) has become
exceedingly difficult. Most currently in use healthcare systems
are generally centralized, making them susceptible to single
points of failure and data loss. The disclosure of sensitive
information about patients may result in con schemes. Additionally, in managing EHR, the present medical technologies
fall short in providing transparency, dependable provenance,
data integrity, audit, confidentiality, and security. Blockchain
technology has the capacity to address these issues in the present healthcare systems. By 2025, it is predicted that blockchain technology’s approval could save between $100 and
$150 billion annually in expenditures associated with data
breaches, frauds, and pirated items [4].
The WHO has reported a global epidemic caused by
COVID-19, which was brought on by the severe, serious
breathing illness. A temperature sensor-based respiratory
tracking system became more necessary as a result [5,34]. Particularly following the COVID-19 epidemic shutdown, it may
be expected that between 40 and 50 percent of individuals
globally suffer from some sort of hypertension. Moreover, during this shutdown time, the development of new technologies,
IoT, and E-health can assist the functioning of the health service without causing the virus to propagate via direct interaction with infected sufferers [6]. Due to various factors, people
are more prone to get dangerous diseases. Therefore, it is
important to check people’s blood pressure levels as well [6].
Information about healthcare is essential to everyone. It keeps
a concrete record of our bodies. It is crucial for the identification and management of illnesses [7]. As machine learning has
fast developed, patient records have turned into a valuable
asset. It has the potential to develop medical methods for artificial intelligence as well as to assist in diagnosis. Compared to
paper documents, EHR were easier to access and maintain, but
greater care still should be taken to guarantee that the data’s
confidentiality is preserved [8]. Many clinics and organizations
have restricted data transmission and interchange in order to
avoid information privacy breaches. As a result of medical
information being spread throughout multiple medical facilities, data obstacles have emerged. Security and privacy issues


with healthcare data also cause other issues. For security reasons, patients must, for instance, undergo a new examination
each time they visit a different hospital. Energy and resources
are wasted by this action. Medical data is not shared with
research institutes due to patient privacy concerns, which hinders medical advancement. It has prompted the quest for safe
data storage as well as transmission techniques, and blockchain is extensively utilized for sharing medical data since it
is decentralized and tamper-proof [9]. To allow continuous
scanning of international life science data, Innoplexus integrates blockchain with artificial intelligence. A system makes
information available to research organizations and medicinal
firms. A platform called BlockRx has been productively
employed in actual applications. The system includes powerful
digital ledger technologies from iSolve with blockchain. The
platform incorporates health information from the research
and biomedical organizations. BlockRx has made significant
progress since it was first implemented in practice [10].
By delivering exceptional data efficiency and upholding
trust, blockchain is a capable network, which has the possibility to improve healthcare processes and systems [11]. It provides a variety of noteworthy and integrated features, such
as decentralized storing, accessibility, integrity of data, and
authentication, flexibility in data access, connectivity, and
safety, allowing broader use of blockchain- based for handling
healthcare data. Blockchain makes use of the concept of
‘‘smart contracts,” that define terms and regulations that are
acknowledged by every medical system players and do away
with the necessity for an intermediary[12]. It lowers wasteful
administrative expenses. Peer-to-peer networking, public key
encryption, and concurrency control, to name a few, are the
three primary elements that underpin blockchain. The three
components of public, private, and consortium blockchains
are based on managing authorization. On blockchain networks, agreements could be reached by anybody with an Internet access. Public blockchains combine finance with encoded
digit identification using proof-of-work or proof-of-stake
methods. The identity of every participant is kept largely
anonymous yet the entire public blockchain network is transparent. In a private blockchain, the network is under the control of just one company. As a result, for this particular
blockchain architecture to reach agreement, a reliable agent
is needed. The advantages of both private and public different
blockchains are mutual in the consortium blockchain (see
Fig. 1). Just specific organizations who want to improve communication with one another should use it. Healthcare firms
can adopt any form of blockchain network, as each one has
advantages and disadvantages that can be tailored to specific
demands or use case situations[13].
In smart healthcare where users’ source documents are necessary for medical treatments, the conventional privacypreserving strategies focused upon brief or producing distortion data are ineffective. Novel privacy-preserving strategies
grounded on Blockchain (BC) technologies have recently been
presented by study to overcome this problem [14–16]. A peerto-peer network uses blockchain, a permanent timestamp
record of blocks, to store and distribute data in a distributed
way. There is no requirement for centralized power because
blocks in BC are distributed by every network participant.
The aspect of data protection and user confidentiality is one
of the main challenges, nevertheless, in additional to the storage pressure brought on by the large amount of data. On the

one side, users’ anonymity can be easily violated due to the
open and visible structure of the blockchain. On the other
hand, users’ health data must be accessible to approved expert
healthcare professionals, such as doctors or AI health analysts.
Users’ health information should be secured as a result, and
the encrypted data must be subject to fine-grained network
access. Only licensed healthcare professionals have access to
a specific user’s health information. Health-chain gives customers the ability to upgrade encryption keys, cancel, and
add achieving high quality health professionals at any time
for improving the adequate security of health data[17].
In this article, a BC-based access control architecture is
proposed that protects patients’ privacy. Instead of storing
the original data, the patient’s medical information is acquired.
As the study clusters the miners to avoid redundant information and prevent their participation in the consensus operation,
the study adapts the basic Blockchain framework to increase
its effectiveness in the medical area. Additionally, the length
of transmission is limited to be small for transmission over
BC in order to avoid network overhead. Owners of sensitive
data may specify access policies for those pieces of information
with BCHealth. In contrary to the rest of BC-related activity,
which publishes information on other servers and then implements access control mechanisms, the Blockchain health architecture forbids the distribution of patients on the BC network
without the user’s agreement. As with the idea of the edge of
the network, blockchain health stores the data remotely on a
device that is nearest to the patient rather than using the internet or a health information center. The resulting reduction in
communication costs and delays would be significant.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The
required blockchain knowledge is covered in Section 2, along
with an examination of similar work. The suggested architecture is presented in Section 3, while blockchain health privacy
and security are assessed in Section 4. The findings of the study
results are presented in Section 5, and the study is concluded
and further research possibilities are suggested in Section 6.


2. Related work

To design a solution that effectively protects data stored in the
Cloud without imposing a significant burden on processing
and transmission. For better preserving the privacy of clinical
data in hybrid servers, this work propose a contrasted clustering and geometric data disturbance strategy in this work. The
K-mean clustering approach is utilized to first divide the highdimensional data into distinct portions, with every split being
treated as a cluster. The mean estimation for every cluster is
then processed, and a comparison among the mean cluster
and cluster member values is then calculated. In the subsequent stage, the grouped information is perturbed using the
Geometric Data Perturbation (GDP) methodology, making
it challenging to obtain the parameters. In contrast to these
disturbed values, which are retained in the cloud platform,
the crucial variables for randomizing and grouping are preserved in the private cloud. If they essentially store every sensitive data on private clouds, the technique would help reduce
the amount of storing upon private clouds. The empirical findings demonstrate that the GDP procedure protects privacy
more effectively than other approaches currently in use. The
GDP methodology still needs to be improved for the study
to achieve a higher level of privacy preservation. The goals
of this work are to investigate privacy-aware, beneficial cloud
scheduling of anonymized data sources by using privacy
preservation as a measurement together with various metrics,
such as stockpiling and calculating later. Data clustering using
this approach is challenging when clusters fluctuate in size and
density [18].
Smart healthcare attempts to create a framework to constantly monitor patient’s health-related data depend on smart
technology as the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) develops. The advancement of secure intelligent healthcare is also
supported by the development of blockchain as well as artificial intelligence technology. The data also are susceptible to
attack as well as privacy leaks because they are kept on a cloud


-----

server. Be aware that the security problem of private information intermingled with original information gathered from a
sizable number of dispersed and heterogeneous smart wearable
equipment has received little attention. The research suggests
deep learning-based predictive analytics as well as privacy protection solution for IoT enabled healthcare to address such
issue. Study get raw data from the users as well as segregate
their personal information in a privacy-isolation zone. Study
analyses health-related data in the cloud while knowing the
personal details of the users and build a sensitive security module utilizing convolutional neural networks. Extensive studies
show the prototype performance of this system and durability
where also deploy as well as assess it. The proposed technique
does not fully guarantee semantic privacy, such as differential
privacy, but it does offer different privacy protection via userdefined confidentiality levels. Enhancing the recommended
solution’s semantic privacy assurance as well as mathematical
validation is thus one possible future research direction. Furthermore, the proposed approach just sanitizes the delicate
language. The detection and sanitizing of terms with semantic
relationships is another possible research field. Due to its insufficient security, this approach is ineffective [19].
To permit algorithms to train on confidential material without sharing it, new advancements in privacy-preserving computer vision are required for Ai technologies for important
healthcare images. PriMIA, a free, open-source software
framework for privacy - preserving, securely aggregated learning algorithm and encrypted predictions on medical image
data, is introduced. PriMIA was put through its paces by study
who used an actual case scenario where a deep convolutional
neural system trained by specialists was used to categories paediatric chest X-rays. The method’s classification results in comparison to that of a locally trained insecurity classification
model. Study empirically and theoretically evaluate the effectiveness as well as privacy assurances of the architecture, and
they show that the safeguards put in place stop a gradientbased modeling inversion approach from reconstructing useful
data. Considering the suggested protocol changes, the computing necessities for implementing the system are significant, as
well as the delay resultant from encryption inferences remains
extremely high in comparison to unencrypted reasoning. The
fundamental remote execution framework presently provides
limited GPU functionality; full support is anticipated for a
later release. High quality of the data on the networks is a
key factor in FL models’ performance. The accuracy of the
data is measured on how much each dataset contributes to
the algorithm or to identify local overfitting, remain to be
researched. In an honest-but-curious system, which they see
as the norm in healthcare organizations, the library is intended
to be utilized. As a result, despite the fact that study offer comprehensive data protection security protocols, they did not
include any particular defensive measures against malware
accomplishments of lower quality or adversarial information
to the FL procedure or to ensure that the framework employed
in the implication configuration is the one that had offered to
the data controller. In addition, study emphasize that considerations of the con problem statement ceptual adversary model
are an abstraction layer that does not adequately capture the
complexities of actual events. For this strategy to work, a substantial of training data is required [20].
A significant category of medical data that includes rich
spatially and temporally information is time-series medical


imaging. These image sequences are typically subjected to
state-of-the-art computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) methods to
increase analytical precision. However, these CAD methods
were frequently forced to upload medical photos to servers
that are honest yet curios, which raises serious privacy issues.
The available CAD algorithms do not permit evaluation of
entire encryption consecutive frames in order to maintain privacy the results in the loss of crucial temporal information
between frames. HE-CLSTM is presented for evaluating
time-series clinical data that have been encrypted using a completely homomorphic encryption algorithm in order to address
this difficulty. To be more precise, LSTM-based analysis software layers (HE-LSTM) are used to encode time-based dependencies from the encrypted image sequences while a number of
convolutional blocks are built to retrieve discriminatory spatial information. Additionally, to enhance performance as well
as lower the rate of missed diagnoses, weighting units as well as
a sequential voting level are created to combine both temporal
and spatial variables with distinct values. Compelling evidence
that the framework could encode visual representations, as
well as sequential interactions from encrypted clinical image
sequences, is provided by the findings on two demanding
benchmarks. The system obtained AUCs above 0.94 both on
the Cervigram and BreaKHis sets of data, comprising a substantial margin of a quantitative impact compared over several
existing techniques. The proposed approach still takes too long
to analyses the encrypted images because it uses the BFV cryptosystem. Study determined to make the method’s computations simpler in upcoming work. Another prospective
difficulty stems from its adaptability to different kinds of medical picture data. It also requires more research to confirm how
well HE-CLSTM performs on other databases. Web - based
learning applications like classification and prediction when
the input data is not a series aren’t well suitable for this
method [21].
The EHR technology that gathers a vast quantity of information every day has expanded the possibilities of data analysis
on healthcare information to provide better healthcare care. In
the current situation, the hospital keeps up its EHR system and
preserves the specific patient data. Data from every EHR system, regardless of where it is situated, must be saved at the centralized data processing server in order for data mining to
improve healthcare. Privacy risks arise from the accumulation
of health information on an unreliable central data mining system. Patients’ private data contained in healthcare data are
shared for data analysis, which raises privacy concerns. The
majority of prior studies either concentrated on the
information-losing k-anonymity approach, which lowers data
mining effectiveness, or on privacy-preserving data mining,
which concentrates on a single data mining method. In this
research, they describe a unique approach for healthcare data
gathering and mining using source anonymization as a
privacy-preserving method. The strategy collects data from
all EHR systems without affecting its validity, stores it on a
solitary, centralized information mining system, as well as
ensures that privacy is protected. A central data mining system
aids in the based on the obtained data utilizing various tools
and techniques without the need for EHR systems. The plan
is resistant to collaboration against EHR systems, including
centralized data mining servers. The effectiveness of our plan
in terms of calculation and communication costs is demonstrated by theoretical and experimental analysis. The experi

-----

mental findings utilizing a dataset for heart disease demonstrate
the benefit of using the suggested approach in EHR systems in
terms of disease predictive performance. The study must be
altered nevertheless, to incorporate the constant joining and
quitting of EHR systems. The dynamical joining and departing
of EHR systems is not explained by this strategy [22].
The IoT has finished incredible strides in the distribution of
medical data also activating the related appropriate measures
within the modern world, with developing web frameworks
automation and computerizing numerous industrial and household applications. Present-day difficulties include sharing
healthcare-related information across destination node, protecting privacy, as well as maintaining data integrity. Particularly in the case of healthcare-related collected data,
information should be encrypted to guarantee the privacy of
the confidential material transferred among the networks. It
might not be practically possible to implement traditional cryptographic techniques via the access point, and it is not recommended to place an excessive amount of load on them. The
purpose of the study has concentrated upon numerous safety
threats with the current system, existing security solutions for
IoT-driven health checking architectures, and a state-of-theart framework that is context-aware and predicated on Blockchain technology that was used to encode data between nodes
in the infrastructure of a 5G network. The recommended
approach succeeded in comparison to existing one when the
proposed approach has been evaluated using a variety of performance evaluation indicators. Since the data uploaded to
the network cannot yet be changed, an effective model must
be developed to track the changes made to the blockchain network. The quantum blockchain system can accurately handle
the storage capabilities across all of the administration nodes
in the network and adequately allocate the load of ledger maintenance with decentralized activities. The storage proficiency of
this research has to be increased [23].
Wireless sensor systems’ suggested energy-efficient multisensor data sample and fusing with judgement for individual
health risk assessment. Three processes make up the process
multisensor data fusing, energy-efficient sampling rate modification, and judgement. Every biosensor performs samples, and
it adjusts its rate according to the local hazard and the global
hazard. The coordinating computes the global hazard, and the
information is then combined. Lastly, judgements are made
based on the patient’s risk level. Whenever an emergency is
identified, a choice is taken in accordance with the analysis
of these tasks, which permits in real-time the implementation
of the biosensor sampling rates depending on the dynamically
riskiness of every biosensor. Utilizing real health datasets, the
effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed, and several of
its characteristics—such as the rates at which information is
reduced and energy is consumed—are compared to those of
an existing system. The obtained findings show a reduction
in the amount of data collected, resulting in a large saving
energy while maintaining the quality and integrity of the information. Additionally, by employing an advance warning rating
system to offer a data fusion modeling at the coordinating
levels, it was possible to evaluate the patients’ state of health
and make the right choice whenever spotting crises. Due to
its lack of specificity and robustness, this approach is ineffective [24].
For minimising the sent EEG traffic from Patient Data
Aggregator (PDA) to the destinations, a feasible EEG Fractals


compressing model is suggested. The suggested paradigm facilitates the exchange of EEG patient information and enhances
Wireless Body Sensor Network by lowering network activity.
The chosen Fractals Block Size is discovered to be the crucial
factor in providing greater Compression Ratio (CR) and driving the necessary Percentage Residue Differential (PRD) when
the primary modeling parameters are examined. The suggested
model has entirely surpassed existing strategies in terms of outcomes and effectiveness. The resulting CR might be as high as
160 while maintaining a PRD below 1. This approach is inefficient since it involves more lossy[25].
This study states a lossless electroencephalogram (EEG)
data compression method with epileptic seizure identification
for IoMT systems. Three functions are accomplished by the
suggested strategy. Initially, it uses lossless EEG data compression depending on a hybrid technique of k-means cluster and
Huffman encodes (KCHE) at the edge gateway to decrease
the quantity of information transported from the edges to
the fog gateway. The epileptic seizure detector-based Naive
Bayes (ESDNB) method is used to determine the patient’s
epileptic seizure condition at the fog gateways. Utilizing the
same lossless compression method used in the initial phase, it
minimizes the size of IoMT EEG data sent to the cloud. The
usefulness of the recommended technique has been demonstrated by a variety of measurements, and comparing findings
reveal that the KCHE minimizes the quantity of EEG data
supplied to the fog and cloud platforms and delivers an accurate epileptic seizure identification. For all EEG data, the average compression strength of the suggested KCHE is four times
more than the average compression strength of previous
approaches (Z,F,N,O, and S). Additionally, utilizing the set
of data from Bonn University, the suggested ESDNB outperforms than the other approaches in terms of accuracy, with
accuracy ranging from 99.53% to 99.99%. Since there is a loss
in compressing, this approach is ineffective [26].
In order to assess patient health in periodical WBSNs while
using less energy, this study proposes an AREDaCoT (adaptive rate energy-saving data collection method). Durations
are used in the AREDaCoT’s operation. Redundancy elimination and sample rate adjustment are the two processes of every
period. The initial phase makes use of an enhanced LED to
eliminate redundant measurements of the vital signs, while
the second phase utilises 2 distinct methods to determine the
risk rating in accordance with the patient’s risk level and the
calibrate sampling rate in order to adjust the detector sample
selection ratio. The effectiveness of AREDaCoT has been
assessed in comparison to conventional methods using many
series of simulations using actual health datasets. The obtained
findings demonstrate how AREDaCoT reduces the amount of
data collected, resulting in a considerable energy reduction
while maintaining data integrity and quality. Additionally,
both the rating discrepancies among them and the percentage
outcomes of data analysis over the original set of information
are suitable. This methodology does not demonstrate how well
it performs in terms of energy use, upholding integrity of data,
or efficacy on overall decision correctness [27].

3. Problem statement

Given the constrained data processing and storage capability
of IoT devices, users’ health data is often maintained in a cen

-----

tralized third party, such as a patient’s medical record or
clouds. As a result, consumers have less control over their
health information, which increases the likelihood of illegal
exposure and single-point bottlenecks. Thus, smart healthcare
apps encounter a number of significant issues, including privacy and security of data. One of major security challenegs
is protecting the privacy of healthcare systems. For clarity,
Privacy-sensitive healthcare data are typically kept on a webserver and handled remotely. People start to worry about the
security and privacy of their information as a result. This is
because a variety of security assaults are feasible under such
circumstances. For instance, an auhtrized user may intercept
healthcare data over the Internet, change it, and then insert
incorrect facts into healthcare information center, or it could
steal information from distant servers. In healthcare systems
where consumers’ original data are necessary for medical therapies, the conventional privacy-preserving techniques focused
on summarizing or producing noisy data are ineffective. Academic researchers have recently proposed new privacypreserving protocols based on BC technology as a possible
solution to the problem of secure healthcare data management.
Due to its immutability and transparency attributes, Blockchain has been viewed as a promising alternative for the secure
management of healthcare records. However, there is a tradeoff between the openness of the system and the privacy of user
information, which has hindered the widespread implementation of Blockchain in medical systems. While some studies
have considered patient privacy protection and offered alternatives, recent models have not well-taken data owners’ desires
for access control into account. In general, Blockchain is utilized to store data hashes and access controls to improve the
availability and integrity of users’ information. By storing this
information in a Blockchain, it can guard against Denial of
Service (DoS) attacks and single failure points. Therefore,
the authors suggest an efficient system for access control that
uses Blockchain technology for e-health applications. They
also proposed a framework to address the issue of balancing
transparency with network access by allowing patients to
choose their preferred access controls while preserving the privacy of their medical information.

4. Methodology

Blockchain is utilized in the suggested architecture to store
hashes of users’ healthcare information as well as users’ access
control policies for their data[28]. Who can acquire the users’


data is determined by the policies. The following major modules make up the system architecture. Fig. 2 depicts the proposed system model.
Every patient is equipped with numerous sensors that are
fastened to their body and used for monitoring the patient’s
vital signs like blood pressure and heart rate. Such sensors
have limited resources, including computing power, electricity,
and storage. Taking into account these restrictions, sensors
transmit the data they have gathered utilizing short-range
communications, includes Zigbee or Bluetooth, to a more capable device, like a smartphone or a Personal Digital Assistance
(PDA) that acts as a gateway to transport the information to
the medical servers [29].
In comparison to sensors, PDA and smartphones get more
computational power and battery life. They can perform
demanding activities, including cryptographic operations
including packet transmission across long-distance networks
like cellular one for IoT Health Manager (IHM) [30].
IHM may simply be a PC that stores health information
and does the following tasks, including such receiving and
maintaining data from smartphone devices carrying out cryptographic processes such as hashing transferring information,
and policy hashes to the Blockchain network of the health
center.
All of a country’s health centers may be included to the hospitals and health centers section. They oversee the BC network, mining, and user information. They get user data and
policy hashes from IHMs and store them. They are in charge
of registration users data (patients, medical personnel, etc.)
and assigning a health wallet (HW) and a cluster mining to
every one of them so that they may interact with the BC
network.
Basic controls and information hashes are maintained in
BC to improve the reliability and integrity of user information

[31]. Effective data maintenance in a BC is protected from DoS
attacks and singular areas of failure. User information and
policy are hashed and kept in two distinct ledgers. It would
be easier to maintain such two distinct structures for
transactions.
Every hospital and health center in the architecture has a
number of miners. New transactions are verified by the miners
before being added to the BC ledger. Although there are difficulties, including how to persuade and inspire miners outside
the clinic to save data, miners outside the health centers could
also be utilized. Adopting proof of the staffs is not feasible
given the enormous amount of IoT devices are dealing with.

In order to achieve this, a novel technique known as Practical
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) voting-based consensus

[32], is employed that calls for numerous levels of voting from
each network node. It aids in improving network security and
efficiency while lowering network costs, such as bandwidth and
processing utilization.
For the purpose of maintaining data integrity within the
conventional blockchain, every node must hold redundant
information that is the similar instance of the ledger. Although
this is beneficial for financial systems like crypto currencies, it
dramatically lowers network throughput. It is because every
transaction needs to be spread throughout the network’s
nodes. The miners are grouped into clusters and keep the medical records of every patient in a single cluster to prevent this
overhead. While they all run simultaneously, each cluster is
autonomous. This equalizes the load across several clusters.

4.1. Data access policy

Through Health Wallet, the data controller in BCHealth
establishes specific access policies. The patient registers the
required access control policies in blockchain as an exclusive
form of transmission known as a policy transmission that is
recorded within the BC network’s policy chain [33]. In order
to accomplish this, the data owner could search up the ID of
the clinical staff member in the database of their registered
health center and authorize them access. In addition to giving
access policies immutability, this will accelerate every chain’s
search process. It goes without saying that each user can create
and implement a single policy at a time for a set of data. For
instance, one can declare in a policy transmission, which a doctor has access to every one of their health information or that
access is only permitted for a certain amount of time. A 7-tuple
could have been used to specify each policy, as shown
below:.hOid; Rid; T; Et; hsD; eDi; Vi

� Oid specifies the Patients ID.
� Rid is the ID for the user who has access to the information.
� T is the kind of information that is accessible to authorized
users.
� Et is the expiration date of the policy.
�hsD; eDi it outlines the time frame for the data’s accessibility.
For example, a clinician can only view patient information
that has been recorded on a specific date.
� V is a binary number that shows the policy’s integrity, with
value ‘‘1[00] denoting policies which are acceptable and value
‘‘0” those that are invalid.

Users are unable to modify a policy that before expire period since the BC ledger is immutable. When a patient requests
that a specific user rescind their access, HW creates the same
policy transactions in BC with the value ‘‘V ¼ 0. ” Algorithm
1 explains the specifics.


Table 1 displays two illustrations of policies. For two years,
from 20 May 2016 to 20 May 2018, the patient whose
ID X gave the clinical personnel having ID A permission for
reading their heartbeat data. The policy is in effect until
November 20, 2020. The second policy states that the similar
patient has cancelled the clinician staff’s authorization to view
every one of their data from July 6 through July 7 from the
identifier B.

4.2. Data storage and retrieval

4.2.1. Interaction between PDA to IHM

The patient’s PDA categorizes the sensory information it
receives based on the sort of data it contains, ECG, heartbeat,
temperature, sensor, EEG. Such data is encrypted using a symmetric encryption technique, such as AES, using a key that is
first shared among the PDA as well as the IHM. A schematic
illustrating how the smartphone (or PDA) and IoT health
management communicate is shown in Fig. 3. The IHM uses
the accept message as an acknowledgement that it has received
data.

4.2.2. Interaction between IHM and blockchain

The IHM creates a hash of the data after obtaining the health
information from the sensors as well as supplies the information. After that, a transaction with this hash value is shared
to blockchain and kept in the ‘‘Data Chain.” As given in Eq.1:

Hash ¼ HðDkSkTÞ ð1Þ

Here, D is the received data from the sensors, S is the date
of received data; T is the data type.
The interaction between the health managers (IHM) and
the Blockchain is given in Fig. 4. In this process, Oid is the
id of the patient that developed the transaction. Oenc corresponds the asymmetric encryption method, which utilizes the
private key of the data owner.
A binary value called emergency determines whether the
input is urgent or not. IHM analyses information based on
the kind of data after it receives it if the data value falls or rises
outside of the expected range. If an emergency occurs, the
value will be set to 1; otherwise, it’ll be zero.
The interaction between the IoT health management and
blockchain to transmit policy transmission is depicted in
Fig. 5.

4.2.3. Accessing the healthcare data

Medical personnel or any other user who requires access to the
patient’s information should submit a request to the BC network after the information has been stored in BC. Clinical
staff makes a request for permission to the BC with the necessary details, such as the patient’s ID, data type, the beginning
dates of the data, in order to access patient information,

including EEG. Every mining in the BC that receives such
request shows up the requester’s authorization in the policy
chain (i.e., the medical staff) before proceeding. The miner
would submit a request transmission to the IHM with the hash
data and ID of the requester if the requester is permitted. The
IHM then verifies the demand; if it is legitimate, it forwards the
patient’s raw information to the clinical team.


4.2.4. Alerting healthcare staff

By transmitting the variable ‘‘1[00] within the emergency feature
of the transmission process, the IHM could indicate if a data
transmission is an emergency. A miner that accepts an emergency transmission looks up the healthcare staff members that
are permitted access towards this patient’s information in the
policy chain. The miner notifies the medical personnel of the


-----

patient’s emergency by sending an emergency request to them
all.

4.2.5. Mining with access control

Controlling requester accessibility for the patient’s information based on particular policy transmissions is among the
key responsibilities of miners in BCHealth. A miner should
validate any request transactions it receives from users that
include the patient’s ID, the type of data, the beginning time,
as well as the length of the data.
If the transaction is acceptable, the miner looks for policies, which are specified for the required data inside the policy
chain. The hash data would have been provided for the IoT
health management if the requester is valid. Fig. 6 depicts
the process of access control procedure.

4.3. Analysis of privacy and security

The Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) security
trial is used to examine the security and privacy of the proposed framework aspects in order to demonstrate how robust
it is to various threats.
Only users with permission can access the communications
because of their confidentiality. For protecting the privacy of
the acquired information, the communications between the
smartphone and the IHM is transferred using symmetric key
encryption. Additionally, the IHM and Block-Chain’s communication is protected by public-key encryption. Additionally,
the IoT Health Management will be the only entity with accessibility to the patient’s information, which is kept in a safe,
encrypted format.
Data integrity makes sure that no one may alter the data
that has been stored without authorization. Due to BC’s inherent irreversibility, it is immune to illegal data change. Data
hashes are kept in IHM and BC. Because these two-hash codes
still wouldn’t match in the event of an unauthorized modification, manipulation would be detected.
In contrast to its centralized competitors, Blockchain health
does not experience the typical single source of failure or
assault since the decentralized nature of Blockchain. Furthermore, since the accessibility of the policy and data hash within
that group is ensured by the fact that they are maintained
throughout all miner nodes belonging to the same group as
the patient provides enough amount of miner nodes occur in
every group. The IHM stores user healthcare data, which
might be duplicated on other devices connected or kept remotely in the servers of the related hospital to guarantee availability and prevent data loss because of an attack.

5. Result and discussion

The majority of research works on the use of blockchains use
open-source programs already in existence, including Hyperledger and Ethereum, to execute and assess the effectiveness
of their recommendations. However, because the fundamental
BC structure is significantly changed in BCHealth (clustering
the nodes, taking into account various topologies, adopting
the PoA Consensus Algorithm among the nodes in every cluster, and using various chains. The existing study and findings
were unable to conduct the experimental evaluation using the
available tools.


Fig. 6 Flowchart for process of access control.

To create user applications, or HW, for producing transactions, Python is used. On the BC network, the miners’ program
is setup for receiving and archiving transactions along with
block mining, as well as applications for transmitting user
access transactions. The Mininet network emulator is utilized


-----

to create the BC network topology. With the computer that
has a dual-core CPU as well as 4 GB of RAM, Mininet was
run. A network of 12 different miner nodes with the same
capabilities also processing capacity as the BC network layout.
Also it evaluated and recorded both policy and data transactions on this network. Four nodes were also taken into account
as the IHM for creating user healthcare transmissions as well
as sending them to the BC network.
Concerning the data that is available in the IHM, it can
be taken into account multiple selection for backing up data
if there are emergency cases such as the patient’s IHM, which
includes guardians, whose location is indicated using the
patient during the initialization stage, and (2) centrally storing
it in the healthcare facility. The latter runs counter to the entire
notion of decentralization. In light of the first possibility, one
would contend that such backup data is vulnerable to assaults
and misuse. Adopting Secret Sharing techniques might be one
answer to that.
Health information has historically been regarded as sensitive information, making its storage on the Blockchain problematic from a privacy and security perspective.
Anonymizing and access control techniques are just two of
the options that have been put out in the blockchain to resolve
this concern. These techniques can be classed as cryptographic
or non-cryptographic procedures. Elliptic Curve Cryptography is used on a blockchain-based infrastructure to encrypt
personal information. A blockchain-based Healthcare Data
Gateway (HDG) program that estimates and saves the
encoded data immediately upon the private blockchain cloud
network without disclosing the original information. Although
they don’t offer mechanisms for controlling access and the
patient has no control over their data, these solutions promote
data security and privacy.
The two primary approaches for storing EHRs in blockchain are off chain storage and direct storage of the medical
data (raw or hash). A significant computing and storage cost
is imposed by the first method. Additionally, because the replicated information has been archived in every node, the likelihood of data leakage grows. The metadata is kept within the


blockchain for validation and reliability, while the underlying
information will be encoded as well as held by a reliable server,
including Cloud.

5.1. Efficiency of the access control procedure

The time it takes for the health workers to obtain the information from the time the request is submitted to the BC until the
information is received is referred to as the access time and
includes the following:

� The amount of time needed to request access to the
blockchain
� The duration of the data and policy chains’ searches
� The duration of time needed to send data from the blockchain to the IoT Health Management
� The amount of time needed for the clinician to receive the
information from the IHM.

Because the data is not accessed while the policy chain is
lost, it is not necessary to seek the data chain, which drastically
reduces the access time. Additionally, it is evident that adding
more clusters will reduce access time in instances with two
clusters.
In BCHealth, policy transactions are recorded via a policy
chain. To prevent illegal access to the patient’s information,
every miner must confirm the request after obtaining an access
request transaction. As a result, in order to locate relevant policy transactions, miners must look for policy in the policy
chain. The search duration is accessed, or the access control
algorithm’s processing time. To do this, network with a set
of random interactions is tested, and measured how long it
took to identify the appropriate policy. According to various
clustering methods, the outcomes of the search time for varying amounts of transactions are shown in Fig. 7. The time it
takes to find the desired transactions grows together with the
volume of transactions. Due to the spread of policy transactions over more clusters, a significant reduction in this time will
result from doing so.


Fig. 7 Amounts of excuted transactions in various clusters.

5.2. Transaction time process

On an Android smartphone and a computer, the processing
speed is measured, correspondingly. For a number of significant cryptographic algorithms, the detail processing time can
be calculated, as shown in Table 2. Table 2 demonstrates that


the RSA signature takes substantially longer to perform than a
number of other cryptographic algorithms. The patient and
staff’s time to execute the transaction is then rigorously tested.
TxIoT, TxKey, and TxDiag are generated in 4.567, 0.025, and
0.025 ms, respectively. The fact that every processing durations
are the median of 10,000 repeated trials should also be
highlighted.

5.3. Comparison with the traditional approach

For the production of user transactions using the system, the
computation cost and communication cost are contrasted with
those of the conventional approach. In the conventional
approach, the sender uses a symmetric key to encode the data.
The symmetric key is then transferred and encoded using the
recipient’s public key, as well as the encrypted data. But keep

in mind that IoT data updates could happen considerably
more regularly than critical updates. Rather than changing
the key every time the IoT transaction is changed, users
could modify key transactions as needed under our method.
The contrast between the method and the conventional
scheme’s computational time overhead for the production of
user transactions is shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 9 compares the communication costs associated with creating user transactions
using the system with the conventional system.
As seen in Figs. 7 and 8, as the system utilization time
increases, both calculation cost and communication cost rise.
According to Fig. 7, it only takes 96 s for a person who has
been around for six months, whereas the conventional solution
takes 130 s. The time it takes for users to produce transactions
is shorter with Health-chain than it is with the conventional
system.
As depicted in Fig. 8, when the system has been in place for
six months, user-generated transactions in Health-chain are
3 MB in size, compared to 26 MB for the previous method.
On the one hand, this suggests that Health-chain can significantly reduce the communication burden placed on users when
sending transactions compared to the conventional system. It
also shows that the plan could cut down on the level of userdeveloped transactions and thus further cut down on blockchain storage.


5.3.1. Processing time

The amount of time needed to complete a computing operation is called the computing time. Table 3 depicts the comparison of the proposed system computation time and Fig. 10
represent the performance evaluation based on computation
time. The calculation duration is inversely correlated with
the number of rule applications when computing is represented
as a series of rule operations.

6. Conclusion

Due to the IoT significantly increased adoption, remote health
data analysis for the purpose of smart healthcare has recently
attracted a lot of attention. With the growth of the IoT, ehealth is now the most important areas of study (IoT). Due
to the sensitive nature of medical records, it appears to be challenging to secure patients’ privacy. Patient data is frequently
achieved in the cloud in healthcare, which reduces the amount
of control customers have over their personal information. As
per the General Data Protection Regulation, the data owner
does have a right to decide when and how their data was
stored, who could access it, and to what extent. As a result,
the study presented an efficient access control system and suggested a framework to address the challenge of balancing
openness with access control. According to the reuslts, the processing time of the proposed system has 5 s which is high efficiency compared to other conventional approaches. Healthchain also prevents medical conflicts by making changing or
removing IoT data or doctor diagnoses hard. The suggested
experimental data and security evaluations demonstrate
Health-chain’s potential for application in smart healthcare
systems. The extensive experimental examination reveals the
block chain’s efficiency in terms of computing and time consuming as well as its ability to fend off various security attacks.
This study will implement the design in the upcoming and conduct an exploratory method to assess how well the suggested
architecture performs. Although the proposed method shows

promising results, there are potential limitations in its ability to
resist future quantum attacks that may arise in the future with
the development of quantum computing. Future work should
focus on developing quantum-resistant cryptography
techniques.
